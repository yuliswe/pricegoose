THE PRICEGOOSE LICENSE

PRICEGOOSE is the creative work of a group of CO-AUTHORS. CO-AUTHORS are people
who have contributed to the creation and collection process of resources
contained in this repository, which include and are not limited to data,
programming code, documentation, artwork, and designs.

Before contributing to this repository, one agrees to grant all current and
future CO-AUTHORS lifetime, non-transferable, non-sublicensable copyright of
ones work under one condition: all CO-AUTHORS are free to exercise these rights
as long as the purpose is to contribute to PRICEGOOSE, and the contribution is
seen as beneficial by the majority of CO-AUTHORS at the time the contribution is
made. These rights are not to be revoked when one stops being a CO-AUTHOR for
any reason. These rights include and are not limited to:

  - Reproduction rights: the rights to make copies of others work
  - Distribution rights: the right to sell or distribute copies of others work to the public
  - Right to create adaptations: the right to prepare new works based on others' work
  - Performance and display rights: the rights to perform others work or to display others work in public

For any purpose other than contributing to PRICEGOOSE, under no circumstance one
shall make use of other CO-AUTHORS' work without permission from the person who
created the work. However, one shall be free to use one's own work for other
purposes that are unrelated to PRICEGOOSE, provided the work is not based on
other CO-AUTHORS' work, and the intended purpose does not directly or indirectly
harm or compete with PRICEGOOSE.
